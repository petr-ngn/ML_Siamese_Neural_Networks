# Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks

Within the course __*Agile Project of Machine learning Applications (4IZ481)*__ at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, Prague University of Economics and Business, our task was to develop a Machine Lerning model for face image recognition and detection, using Tensorflow and Keras.

Particularly, I have developed a Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks with Contrastive Loss, which was further tuned with Bayesian Optimization while minimizing a loss function on validation set, and was built on the generated balanced pairs of images.
